Our Approach to
Sustainable Banking
In 2020, the Group embarked on a path of more intensive integration of
sustainability into banking operations. If until this year it was possible to
detect the activities of banks in the Slovenian financial sector in the direction
of more ecologically and socially acceptable operations, the COVID-19
pandemic strengthened banking agendas related to environmental and social
risk management, and thus more comprehensive implementation of the
ESG factors. The Group’s social role has been stipulated in its Social and
Environmental Policy (more information available on www.nlb.si/social-
responsibility), which has paved the way for more than a decade’s work on
responsible banking. However, the Bankʼs ambition is to increasingly focus
on sustainability integration and translate it into a real value-added. ",2020
