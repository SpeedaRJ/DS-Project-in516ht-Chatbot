# Robert Jutre≈°a's Data Science Project Competition journal

## March 2020 (8h)

* **1st (1h)**: Meeting with everyone - quick conversation about the data we are working with, establishing expectations, deciding on preliminary goals, setting up feature meetings and weekly schedule.
* **6th (2h)**: Working with my coworker - we looked at the agreed upon data, outlined important and numerical data, found some extraction tools for images, tables, text etc. We tested some, but not all, of them.
* **8th (30 min)**: Meeting with NLB - we talked about the data again, how they will prepare the question and answers that we will need, we also talked a bit about the scope of the task at hand.
* **9th (30 min)**: Meeting with faculty advisor - most importantly we discussed implementation approaches, as well as data preprocessing and acquisition (Tool-formers, paraphrasing to get more data, use text data not tables).
* **15th (4h)**: Meeting with the client and advisor from the industry - we talked about some starting ideas, decided to do a proof of concept for a simple question-answer generator using a model (1h). Creating and setting up stable conda environment (1h). We found a package *Haystack* with pre-built pipelines (also suggested by NLB). The first implementation was made to see how it would perform (2h).
* **20th (1h)**: Preparing the cleaned version of the extracted questions and answers for the client. Send it over e-mail (1h).
* **30th (30 min)**: Meeting with NLB - talked about the clean data, got an updated set. Talked about Cloud Computing platform with the advisor from the industry and got access to it. Made a plan for the next week.

## April 2020 (14h)
* **4th (6h)**: Working with my coworker - getting a baseline comparison of predictions from a model without fine tunning. Working on the environment, and preparing a feature plan for development and testing of the main model.
* **5th (8h)**: Working with my coworker - original fine tuning, setting up a Sequence Extractive model, planning the next steps, meeting with the professor in the meantime.
