## March 2020 (7h)

* **1st (1h)**: Meeting with everyone - quick conversation about the data we are working with, establishing expectations, deciding on preliminary goals, setting up feature meetings and weekly schedule.
* **6th (2h)**: Working with my coworker - we looked at the agreed upon data, outlined important and numerical data, found some extraction tools for images, tables, text etc. We tested some, but not all, of them.
* **8th (30 min)**: Meeting with NLB - we talked about the data again, how they will prepare the question and answers that we will need, we also talked a bit about the scope of the task at hand.
* **9th (30 min)**: Meeting with faculty advisor - most importantly we discussed implementation approaches, as well as data preprocessing and acquisition (Tool-formers, paraphrasing to get more data, use text data not tables).
* **15th (3h)**: Meeting with the client and advisor from the industry - we talked about some starting ideas, decided to do a proof of concept for a simple question-answer generator using a model (1h). We found a package *Haystack* with pre-built pipelines (also suggested by NLB). The first implementation was made to see how it would perform (2h).
