## March 2020 (17h30min)

* **1st** (1h): Meeting with everyone - quick conversation about the data we are working with, establishing expectations, deciding on preliminary goals, setting up feature meetings and weekly schedule.
* **6th** (2h): Working with my coworker - we looked at the agreed upon data, outlined important and numerical data, found some extraction tools for images, tables, text etc. We tested some, but not all, of them.
* **7th** (30min): Looking at some tools for text extraction
* **8th** (30min): Meeting with NLB advisors
* **9th** (1h):
  * (30min) Reading papers
  * (30min) Meeting with professor
* **11th** (3h): Watching videos and reading papers about attention, transformers, large language models, question answering models
* **12th** (4h):
  * (2h30min) Continue reading papers, gathering info what datasets are used in question answering models, which question answering models are used, what are their differences
  * (1h30min) Reading about the capabilities of haystack (deepset end-to-end framework) and trying to get it to work on my machine
* **13th** (2h): managed to install haystack, trying out it's features
* **15th** (1h): Meeting with NLB and In516ht advisors
* **22th** (30min): Meeting with NLB advisor
* **27th** (1h30min): Reading some papers and started organizing the intermediate report
* **30th** (30min): Meeting with NLB and In516ht advisors

## April 2020 (36h)

* **1st** (2h): Looking through possible models to fine tune on our data and how we should go about it.
* **4th** (6h): Working with my coworker - getting a baseline comparison of predictions from a model without fine tunning. Working on the environment, and preparing a feature plan for development and testing of the main model.
* **5th** (8h): Working with my coworker - original fine tuning, setting up a Sequence Extractive model, planning the next steps, meeting with the professor in the meantime.
* **11th** (8h): Working with my coworker - fine tuning, baseline evaluation, planning the next steps.
* **12th** (10h): Working with my coworker - fine tuning, baseline evaluation, planning the next steps, meeting with the professor and meeting with NLB advisors.
* **13th** (2h): Tweaking, modifying and proofreading the intermediate report, looking at some possibilities for the generative approach.
